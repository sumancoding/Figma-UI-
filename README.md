# Figma-UI-
I've been learning Figma for building UI design. I've created a couple of wireframes which is almost like a high fidelity wireframes along with basic prototyping. I've recorded here for my future reference.   
The first one is basic sinup hich only contain couple of screens for the registering purpose.- https://www.figma.com/file/sM7KkXlCb605nZ7lSzwBya/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

The second one is more appealing. Its basically about a clothing store. Protyping entails the brief view of the entire product.
